Applied Machine Learning at Scale (3 - 21 November 2025)

Ulrich Paquet (Google DeepMind, AIMS South Africa)

ML and AI drive the back-ends and front-ends of many large online companies, and are set to play a transformative role in the “internet of things”. This is a practical module that looks at how ML is applied to internet-scale systems. In this module, students will build their own recommender systems from scratch. Topics covered will include A/B testing, ranking, recommender systems, and the modelling of users and entities that they engage with online (like news stories).
